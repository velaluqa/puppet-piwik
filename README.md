# UNMAINTAINED

Since we stopped using puppet for our infrastructure, we are not going to 
maintain this solution anymore.

# piwik

A puppet module to easily deploy piwik. Make sure you have a
correct php5 installation. This module only downloads the latest
piwik archive and extracts it to a given path.

You may have to install `php5-fpm` (via puppet-php) and configure your
web server (maybe with a puppet nginx module).

## Suggested Preparation

This module is as simple as possible. You should be able to choose
your own php installation. This is my own, which works quite find, as
I find:

1. First I install the
   [nodes/php](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/nodes/php) module.

```
puppet module install nodes/php
```

2. Using this module I install the necessary php packages. For serving
   php I use php-fpm with nginx.

```
class { 'php::extension::mysql': }
class { 'php::extension::mcrypt': }
class { 'php::extension::gd': }
class { 'php::fpm::daemon':
  ensure => running
}
```

3. Then I install piwik. See [[Usage]].

4. At last you may set up your vhost. This is depending on the server
   module you are using. I use my nginx fork

## Usage

```
  class { 'piwik':
    path => "/srv/piwik",
    user => "www-data",
  }
```

*Please note:* After the first installation you have to initialize
 piwik by bootstrapping the database. For this use the setup gui in
 your browser according to the piwik installation manual.

## Plugins

### LoginLdap

LoginLdap is a plugin to enable ldap authentication.

Just make sure you have `php-ldap` installed. Either via a puppet
module like `nodes/php` or via the package resource.

Then use:

```
  class { 'piwik::plugins::loginldap': }
```
